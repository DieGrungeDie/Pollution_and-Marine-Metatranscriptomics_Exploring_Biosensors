#About
The Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) is a region of significant environmental vulnerability due to its strategic importance in global oil transportation, which heightens the risk of oil spills. Traditional methods of monitoring the environmental impact of such contamination are limited in scope and sensitivity. 
This research proposes utilizing metatranscriptomics to identify biomarkers of oil pollution within seawater bacterial communities in the EMS. 
By employing an innovative in-situ diffusion chamber culturing device (CCS) coupled with an automated sampler (PPS), this study aims to overcome the constraints of laboratory settings and provide a more accurate representation of natural conditions. 
The research will focus on the metatranscriptomic analysis of bacterial communities exposed to both anthropogenic (oil spills) and natural (dissolved organic matter) contaminants. 
Preliminary studies have shown the potential of metatranscriptomics in identifying differential gene expression related to oil degradation. 
This study's outcomes will contribute to more effective environmental monitoring and pollution management strategies, advancing our understanding of microbial responses to contaminants and improving the protection of marine ecosystems.
The development of the PPS-DCS deployment has been marked by a series of technical challenges and collaborative problem-solving efforts. Early experiments in 2017 revealed issues with water in DCS syringes, diffusion chamber leaks, and biofouling, prompting discussions on alternative solutions like using Kynar bags and modifying chamber designs. Frequent Skype meetings between Daniel Sher, Tim Shanahan, and others were held to address these issues, leading to testing and adjustments by McLane, such as enlarging screw holes and incorporating internal bags. Modifications continued into 2018, with McLane offering to perform necessary adjustments and repairs, often free of charge, to resolve persistent alignment and performance issues. The project saw a hiatus until 2021 when Jennifer Hennenfeind conducted field sampling and raised concerns about corrosion on electronics. In 2022, efforts to restart the project intensified, involving firmware updates, troubleshooting of communication errors, and seeking replacements for outdated components. More recently in 2024, Carlos Martinez has played a key role in resolving capacitor issues in the DCS system, collaborating with IOLR engineers to disassemble and identify faulty components. Communication with McLane and other experts remains ongoing, highlighting the iterative nature of refining the PPS-DCS systems to achieve reliable performance.
