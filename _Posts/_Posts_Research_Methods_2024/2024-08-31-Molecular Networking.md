# Molecular Networking Homework: CMFI Mass Spec Seminar #5

This repository documents my work following the "CMFI Mass Spec Seminar #5: Molecular Networking" tutorial, which guides users through the process of molecular networking using the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) platform. The focus of this exercise was on analyzing the compound "Rapamycin" within a provided dataset.

### Key Results:

[Molecular Network for Rapamycin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DieGrungeDie/CarlosNotebook/main/_images/Research_Methods_Homework_images/Molecular_Networks4.png)

- **Parent Masses Identified**:
  - 936.544 Dalton
  - 922.575 Dalton
- **DeltaMZ**: 14.015 Da

## Interpretation

The molecular network for "Rapamycin" shows two clusters with parent masses of 936.544 Da and 922.575 Da, with a DeltaMZ of 14.015 Da between them. This mass difference may suggest a specific structural variation or modification.

## Conclusion

This exercise provided practical experience with molecular networking using GNPS, helping to reinforce concepts in mass spectrometry data analysis.
